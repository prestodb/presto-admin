========================
Configuring Presto-Admin
========================
A Presto cluster consists of a coordinator node and one or more workers nodes.
A coordinator and worker may be located on the same node, meaning that you can
have a single-node installation of Presto, but having a dedicated node for the
coordinator is recommended for better performance, especially on larger
clusters.

In order to use ``presto-admin`` to manage software on a cluster of nodes,
you must specify a configuration for ``presto-admin``. This configuration
indicates the nodes on which to install as well as other credentials.

To set up a configuration, create a file ``~/.prestoadmin/config.json``
(or ``$PRESTO_ADMIN_CONFIG_DIR/config.json`` if you have the ``presto-admin``
config directory set using the environment variable) with the content below as
appropriate for your cluster setup. Replace the variables denoted with
brackets <> with actual values enclosed in double quotations. The user
specified by ``username`` must have sudo access, unless the username
is root, on all the Presto nodes, and ``presto-admin`` also must be
able to login to all of the nodes via SSH as that user (see
:ref:`ssh-configuration-label` for details on how to set that up). The
file should be owned by root with R/W permissions (i.e. 622).

.. NOTE::
   The sudo setup for a non-root user must have the ability to run /bin/bash as root. This can be a security issue. The IT organization should take the necessary steps to address this security hole and select an appropriate presto-admin user.

Configuration for Amazon EMR
----------------------------

Use the following configuration as a template for Amazon EMR:
::

 {
 "username": "hadoop",
 "port": "<ssh_port>",
 "coordinator": "<EMR_master_node_host_name>",
 "workers": ["<host_name_1>", "<host_name_2>", ... "<host_name_n>"],
 "java8_home":"<path/to/java8/on/presto/nodes>"
 }

Also, for running Presto Admin commands on Amazon EMR, do the following:

	- Copy the ``.pem`` file associated with the Amazon EC2 key pair to the Presto Admin installation node of the EMR cluster.
	- Use the ``-i </path/to/your.pem>`` input argument when running presto-admin commands on the node.

	  ::

	   </path/to/presto-admin> -i </path/to/your.pem> <presto_admin_command>


Configuration for other clusters
----------------------------------------------
Use the following configuration as a template for other clusters:
::

 {
 "username": "<ssh_user_name>",
 "port": "<ssh_port>",
 "coordinator": "<host_name>",
 "workers": ["<host_name_1>", "<host_name_2>", ... "<host_name_n>"],
 "java8_home":"<path/to/java8/on/presto/nodes>"
 }

All of the properties are optional, and if left out the following defaults will
be used:
::

 {
 "username": "root",
 "port": "22",
 "coordinator": "localhost",
 "workers": ["localhost"]
 }

Note that ``java8_home`` is not set by default.  It only needs to be set if
Java 8 is in a non-standard location on the Presto nodes.  The property is used
to tell the Presto RPM where to find Java 8.

.. NOTE:: If you have installed the JDK, ``java8_home`` should be set so refer to the ``jre`` subdirectory of the JDK.

You can also specify some but not all of the properties. For example, the
default configuration is for a single-node installation of Presto on the same
node that ``presto-admin`` is installed on. For a 6 node cluster with default
username and port, a sample ``config.json`` would be:

::

 {
 "coordinator": "master",
 "workers": ["slave1","slave2","slave3","slave4","slave5"]
 }

You can specify a range of workers by including the number range in brackets in the worker name.  For example:

::

    "workers": ["worker[01-03]"]

is the same as

::

    "workers": ["worker01", "worker02", "worker03"]


.. _sudo-password-spec:

Sudo Password Specification
---------------------------
Please note that if the username you specify is not root, and that user needs
to specify a sudo password, you do so in one of two ways. You can specify it on
the command line:
::

 ./presto-admin <command> -p <password>

Alternatively, you can opt to use an interactive password prompt, which prompts
you for the initial value of your password before running any commands:
::

 ./presto-admin <command> -I
 Initial value for env.password: <type your password here>

The sudo password for the user must be the same as the SSH password.
