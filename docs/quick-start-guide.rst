The following describes installing Presto on one or more nodes via the ``presto-admin`` software. This is an alternative to the installation steps described at `prestodb.io <https://prestodb.io/docs/current/installation.html>`_. Using the ``presto-admin`` tool is the simplest and preferred method for installing and managing a Presto cluster.

For a detailed explanation of all of the commands and their options, see :ref:`comprehensive-guide-label`.
