"""
Provides bare images from existing tags in Docker. For some of the heftier
images, we don't want to go through a long and drawn-out Docker build on a
regular basis. For these, we count on having an image in Docker that we can
tag appropriately into the teradatalabs/pa_tests namespace. Test cleanup can
continue to obliterate that namespace without disrupting the actual heavyweight
images.

As an additional benefit, this means we can have tests depend on images that
the test code doesn't know how to build. That seems like a liability, but it
that the build process for complex images can be versioned outside of the
presto-admin codebase.
