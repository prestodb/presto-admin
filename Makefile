#
# The build process and product tests rely on several base Docker images.
# Teradata builds and releases a number of Docker images from the same
# repository, all versioned together. This makes it simple to verify that your
# test environment is sane: if all of the images are the same version, they
# should work together.
#
# As part of the process of releasing those images, we tag all of the images
# with the version number of the release. This means that anything that uses
# the images can reference them as `teradatalabs/image_name:version'. The
# Makefile needs to know that to pull the images, and the python code needs to
# know that for various reasons.
#
# base-images-tag.json is the canonical source of the tag information for the
# repository. The python code parses it properly with the json module, and the
# Makefile parses it adequately with awk ;-)
